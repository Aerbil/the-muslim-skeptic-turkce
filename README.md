# the-muslim-skeptic-turkce
My second ever website (since I started Harvard's CS50). 

As the best way to learn coding is active learning, I remade the muslimskeptic.com, a leading Muslim news, research and opionion outlet, in order to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript and responsive web development (Bootstrap framework). I also translated it to Turkish except articles.
